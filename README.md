# Technical assignment front-end engineer
Create a minimal news list to create and view articles. An article consisting of at least (but not limited to) a title, a body, the author's email address and a publication date.

Your task is to:

* Create two API endpoints one to add a new article and one to get articles.
* Create two pages, one that lists the last five articles and one to add new articles.

**Minimal requirements**

The three pillars of front-end development are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We would like to see you know how to use them for the right job.
* Use Next.js and React
* Pay attention to semantics: any HTML might work, but choosing the right tags show you care.
* Show us you know how to create a modern user interface using material UI.

**Timing**

You decide yourself how much time and effort you invest in it, but quality(!) and a reasonable delivery time are always highly appreciated.
Please send us an email (jobs@clubee.com) when you think the assignment is ready for review. Please mention your name, Github username, and a link to what we need to review.
